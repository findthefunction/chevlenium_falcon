## Electric Vehicle Interface(s)

1. Sensor Interface design
  - Utilize voltage / speed sensor: Display and analysis
2. Battery / Charge Monitoring
  - Range / Charge information and documentation (
3. Driver media interface
  - Entertainment
  - Visually appealing information readouts
4. Self driving analysis / training set development
5. Autonomous navigation

There are 5 predominant components of self driving cars:
  - Computer vision 
  - Sensor vision
  - Localization
  - Path planning
  - Control








rough notes:
-integrate serviveable components with simplicity and reliability being foremost
-data collection for autonous modeling (route mapping, "assisted" autopilot
  - gravel, backroad, rough terrain, high elevation 
  - inclimate weather 
  - wildlife detection / avoidance
  -
